# Cursor Rules for n8n + Notion Automation Project

## Project Goal
- Automate workflows and data synchronization between n8n and Notion.

## Core Technologies
- Primary: n8n, Notion API
- Secondary: JavaScript/TypeScript (for n8n Code nodes), JSON, APIs, Docker (for n8n deployment)

## Key Components
- n8n Workflows: Design, implementation, and maintenance.
- Notion Databases/Pages: Interaction via Notion API (creating, updating, querying).
- Potential Python Scripts: If external scripts interact with n8n/Notion.

## Configuration & Secrets
- Notion API Key/Integration Token: Manage securely, preferably via environment variables (e.g., `NOTION_API_KEY`). Do not commit secrets.

## Deployment
- Target deployment platform: Railway (for n8n instance). Configure Volumes and Environment Variables correctly.

## Commands
# - Use WSL for terminal commands if interacting outside the n8n container (uncomment if needed).

## Language
- Respond in 中文.
